## Features

- **AI-Based DSA Challenges**: Problems generated based on user-selected difficulty levels with intentional bugs for hands-on learning.
- **AI Chatbot**: Get instant answers to DSA questions using Gemini AI.
- **Generative Learning**: Auto-generated content covering arrays, linked lists, trees, and advanced DSA topics.
- **Telos Blockchain Integration**: Participate in decentralized coding challenges by staking TLOS tokens and earning rewards.

## Earn TLOS with Coding Challenges

Participants stake **TLOS tokens** to join challenges. Successfully solving a challenge earns rewards greater than the staked amount. Rewards are funded by the TLOS staked by unsuccessful participants, with payout scaling based on challenge difficulty.

- **Challenge Contract Address**: [0x3D5c...a7B1 (Telos EVM)](https://teloscan.io/address/0x3D5c...a7B1)  
  *(Sample Telos EVM address - replace with deployed contract)*
